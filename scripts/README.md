Scripts for configuring a server for the app
======================

### Scripts

Before running any script open it and look for `<...>` at the beginning of the file. You need to replace them with some data. Example, replace `<password>` with what you want your password to be. Don't add password and push to git though!


**10-first-minutes** Contain [Första 10 minuter på en server](kunskap/github-education-pack-och-en-server-pa-digital-ocean#first10) as scripts. Use these if you need to create the server again and don't want to install everything manually.

**deploy-app** Contain scripts to deploy the app and install its dependencies. Running these should give you a working server with the app running.

**Read README.md** file in the seperate folders for more instructions on how to use the scripts.
